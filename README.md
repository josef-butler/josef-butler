### 👋 Hi there, I'm Joe

I'm a developer currently working at [Xero][xero]. I like learning new technologies and building awesome apps. At the moment I'm upskilling in C#, .NET and AWS.

Here you can find all my personal projects. I make contributions every now and then, however the majority of the repos here are from my time at [Enspiral Dev Academy][eda] where my journey as a developer began.

I'm always up for a chat so feel free to reach out.
